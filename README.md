I have been testing for about half a year. This is my solution to the misfortune of installing multiple ubuntu, mint, antergos, archlinux etc, which brings kernel panic to users.

I think that there is no fatal bug already, so I will try to make it public. It will be useful for about 3 people worldwide.
